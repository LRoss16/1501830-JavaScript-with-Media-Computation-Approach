# 1501830-JavaScript-with-Media-Computation-Aprroach
Lewis Ross 1501830 Honours Project
The media computation approach was pioneered by Mark Guzdial in America. The purpose of this is to teach students programming through the use of maniupulating media data such as changing the colour of images, flipping images, changing video background to grey etc. 
This has been done with Java and Python and has proved extremely sucessful with pass rates improving and has led to more females taking up Computing as they have found it more appealing with the opportunity to be creative now there. 
The purpose of this project is to prove that this approach is possible with JavaScript. The website designed is educational based with the opportunity to try out examples for arrays, functions etc.
