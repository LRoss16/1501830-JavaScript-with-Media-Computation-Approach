# 1501830-JavaScript-with-Media-Computation-Aprroach
Lewis Ross 1501830 Honours Project
The media computation approach was pioneered by Mark Guzdial in America. The purpose of this is to teach students programming through the use of maniupulating media data such as changing the colour of images, flipping images, changing video background to grey etc. 
This has been done with Java and Python and has proved extremely sucessful with pass rates improving and has led to more females taking up Computing as they have found it more appealing with the opportunity to be creative now there. 

The purpose of this project is to prove that this approach is possible with JavaScript. The website designed is educational based with the opportunity to try out examples for arrays, functions etc. 

A content management system has been implemented, this allows the admin to update the content of the site and also create users. When a teacher has had an account set up they will have their own profile and will be able to update the content to go more in line with what they are teaching if that this necessary, they will also be able to set up accounts for their students, the content that the students see when they login will be what the teacher has set up.
